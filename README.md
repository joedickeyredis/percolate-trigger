# Geographic Search Demo with Redis

## Overview

This repository contains a demonstration showcasing the implementation of GEO polygon search, Redis Streams, and Triggers & Functions (T&F). The specific use case involves adding image metadata, including image coordinates, as a hash to Redis. Subsequently, a search query is triggered against predefined "policies" (hashes) that correspond to specific geographic regions. If an image hash is added to the database and falls within the bounds of a geographic policy, the image data is appended to the corresponding Redis Stream.

## Components

### 1. GEO Polygon Search

The GEO polygon search allows for efficient querying based on geographic coordinates. In this demo, it is employed to search for images within predefined geographical areas.

### 2. Redis Streams

Redis Streams are utilized to store and process the data generated by the demo. They provide a way to append, consume, and process a series of data records in a scalable and efficient manner.

### 3. Triggers & Functions (T&F)

T&F functionality is leveraged to respond to specific events, in this case, the addition of image data to the Redis database. The trigger initiates a search query and, if conditions are met, adds the image data to the corresponding Redis Stream.
